# nearby
The core component of this application is its ability to find other locations near an
existing location. The easiest way to find this information is to take advantage of a
third-party API. For this application, we'll be using the Google Places API, a web
API that can provide nearby locations from given latitude and longitude coordinates.

#Showing locations
Rather than simply telling our users what locations are near a given point of interest,
we can enhance user experience by showing them the points of interest and nearby
locations on a map. Many different mapping sources exist to show a map. For this
application, we'll take advantage of another Google API, the Google Maps API.
